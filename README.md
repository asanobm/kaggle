# Kaggle Study and Competition Repository
---

I'm going to study and analyze the dataset from Kaggle and join the competition. 

However, I will not be actively participating. For now, I just want to see and learn from a lot of data, and participating in Kaggle Competition to receive a prize is still a stretch. But someday, it might be possible.


## DataSet
